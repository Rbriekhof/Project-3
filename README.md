# Task Grab

* Task Grab is an app that connects people to get things done. It could be anything from a small task like mowing a lawn, to full employment as a freelancer. And everything inbetween. The only thing you need to get started is an account. After creating one you are free to browse potential tasks and see if there are any that catch your eye. Otherwise you could create your own if you need a little help on something. And don't worry once you accept a task, the status is changed so that nobody else could also accept it.

* Task Grab does all of the following:
    * Makes sure that only those with accounts can create or accept tasks.
    * Allows the task creator to go into as much detail of the task as they want and also include payment and contact information.
    * Changes task statuses so that tasks can't be taken by two different people or start already completed tasks. 

* Technologies Used:
    * React, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, Bcrypt, ChatKit, Express, Node, and Bootstrap
